<h2>About</h2>

<h1><span class="title_left">Seacast</span></h1>
<hr />

<p>
    Seacast delivers an easy-to-use interface for Oregon coastal fishermen that shows forecasted sea conditions for a three day period. The projections are determined using models provided by Oregon State University's College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences (CEOAS).
</p>

<h3>State of Release</h3>

<p>
    This alpha of Seacast is an early release of work-in-progress for demonstration purposes. The release is targeted for those involved with development, alpha-testers, and Expo visitors. This release is <i>not</i> intended for end users in need of data for safety, commercial, or other purposes at this time.
</p>

<h3>What Seacast Does</h3>
    <p>
        Seacast displays forecasts for currents and sea surface temperature. These conditions are <i>predictions</i>, much like weather forecasts, based on scientists' models. They do not represent actual, real-time readings of ocean conditions, although the models do incorporate actual readings to create the predictions.
        The Seacast website produces a visual display of these conditions, as image overlays on top of a Google Maps background.
        The models used by the site, like all models, have limitations. The Seacast team would like to receive your feedback about both the layout of the website, and the accuracy of the data displayed on the website. This will allow us to improve Seacast, and give feedback to the model creators about their model.

        </p>

    <h3>How To Use Seacast</h3>
    <p>
    Sea Surface temperature is displayed as a colormap, and currents are displayed as vectors (arrows). The arrows point in the direction of the current, and their relative length indicates the speed of the current. Note that the key for current speed, at the bottom of the page, is estimated.
        The overlays are turned on or off with the toggle buttons in the menu bar. The Wave Height and Chlorophyll toggle buttons are greyed-out and not available because those models have not been incorporated yet.


        The model produces predictions for 4-hour intervals for 3 days into the future. Prediction dates/times can be selected from the drop-down menu in the top left corner of the menu. The page will automatically refresh with the conditions for the chosen time.

    </p>
